Hello! My name is Hongsheng Qin , and I am currently a Ph.D. student enrolled in the Fall 2021 semester in the Department of Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT). 

I am fortunate to be under the guidance of Prof. Zhengang Lu from the Department of Instrument at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT, 985). I've embarked on an enriching journey at the intersection of optics and computer science. I also earned my Bachelor's degree in Measurement and Control Technology and Instruments with honors from North China Electric Power University (NCEPU, 211). 

My research interests including defect detection, Light field camera,  computational imaging and Deep learning.
